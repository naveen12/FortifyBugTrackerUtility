Introduction
====
The Maven projects in this repository make up a utility for submitting vulnerabilities from Fortify on Demand (FoD) 
and Fortify Software Security Center (SSC) to bug trackers and other external systems. The following table
lists the currently supported functionalities.

| Target System | From FoD | From SSC | Grouping | State Management | Remarks |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- |--------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| RSA Archer    | Yes      | Yes      | No       | No               | Currently only supports text and value list field types |
| CSV File      | Yes      | Yes      | No       | No               | By default, a separate output file is written for each application version/release. All relevant vulnerabilities are exported on each run, overwriting any existing files |
| Atlassian Jira | Yes     | Yes      | Yes      | Yes              | |
| ALM Octane     | Yes     | Yes      | Yes      | Yes              | |
| Azure DevOps  | Yes     | Yes      | Yes      | Yes              | Additional state transitions may need to be configured |
| SSC Bug Trackers | No    | Yes      | Yes      | Performed by SSC | Sample configuration for SSC Jira bug tracker included, other SSC bug trackers require corresponding configuration files to be added |

For more information about configuring and running the utility, please see the documentation included with the [binary distribution](https://github.com/fortify-ps/FortifyBugTrackerUtility/releases).

Note that this utility provides functionality that is similar to the bug tracker integrations
provided with FoD and SSC, however it takes a different approach than these product-provided 
integrations (with various advantages and disadvantages as described in the documentation).
This is a stand-alone utility that can be invoked manually from the command line, or automatically 
from for example build jobs or as a scheduled task. In particular, note that the utility jar file 
cannot be loaded as a bug tracker plugin in either FoD or SSC.


Building from source
====

Prerequisites
----

### Tools
In order to retrieve the source code and build the project, you will need to have the following tools installed:

* Git client
* Maven 3.x

### Fortify Client API dependencies
Development/snapshot versions of this project (i.e. the master branch or other non-release branches) may depend on
a snapshot version of fortify-client-api. You can verify this by searching the root pom.xml file in this project 
for the following dependency declaration:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.fortify.client.api</groupId>
	<artifactId>client-api-root</artifactId>
	<version>5.10-SNAPSHOT</version>
	<type>pom</type>
	<scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
```

If, as illustrated in this example, the version of this dependency ends with `-SNAPSHOT`, you may first need to 
build this dependency and install the corresponding artifacts in your local Maven repository by following these steps:

* `git clone https://github.com/fortify-ps/fortify-client-api.git`
* `cd fortify-client-api`
* `mvn clean install`

Notes:

* Non-snapshot versions of fortify-client-api are available at https://github.com/fortify-ps/FortifyMavenRepo,
  which is automatically included during the build of this project. As such, non-snapshot versions of 
  fortify-client-api do not need to be built and installed manually.
* By nature, snapshot versions are unstable and may change at any time. As such, you may need to repeat the
  steps described above if there are any changes in fortify-client-api. Also, there is no guarantee that this 
  project will build without errors with the latest snapshot version of fortify-client-api. In this case, you 
  may need to check out a specific commit of fortify-client-api. 
  
Building the project
----
Once all prerequisites have been met, you can use the following commands to build this project:

* `git clone https://github.com/fortify-ps/FortifyBugTrackerUtility.git`
* `cd FortifyBugTrackerUtility`
* `git checkout [branch or tag that you want to build]`
* `mvn clean package`

Once completed, build output like executable JAR file, sample configuration files, and the 
binary distribution zip file, can be found in the bugtracker/target directory.
